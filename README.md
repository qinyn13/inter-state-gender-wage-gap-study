# inter-state-gender-wage-gap-study
An economic study in gender wage gap across states.
It contains R scripts created for an economic analysis on the gender wage gap issue studied from a state view. 
Data can be collected from American Community Survey(IPUMS-ACS). The time ranges from 2007 to 2017.
Regression models are built to calculate the gender wage gap in each state and by controlling variables the gender wage gap
that "can not be reduced" is revealed. We believe this is a quantitative estimate of discrimination and its imbalanced distribution is quite straightforward from the heatmap.
Further evidence can be found to show the correlation between political conservativeness and gender discrimination in US states.
