# inter-state-gender-wage-gap-study
An economic study in gender wage gap across states.
This a R script created for an economic analysis on the gender wage gap issue studied from a state view. 
Data can be collected from American Community Survey(ACS). 
Regression models are built to calculate the gender wage gap in each state and by controlling variables the gender wage gap
that "can not be reduced" is revealed. We believe this is a quantitative estimate of discrimination. And it varies across 
states.
Furthur evidence can be found to show the correlation between conservativeness and discrimination in each state.
